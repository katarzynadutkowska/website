								<p align="justify">Hi! My name is Kasia [ˈkaɕa] Dutkowska (she/her), and currently, I'm a Ph.D. Fellow at the University of Copenhagen and expect to defend at the beginning of 2023. My research focuses on the following question: how do most stars in the Universe form? We know a lot about star formation and yet still lack a consensus on the most fundamental star formation properties. I've decided to approach this problem in a synergetic way by combining observations and modeling. This way, I can bridge Galactic and extragalactic star formation and find out (or at least do my best!) what rules govern star formation and if it happens in the same way everywhere in the Universe. If you want to learn more about it, check out my <a href="#Projects">projects</a>. And if you are interested in my education and experience, check out my <a href="#CV">cv</a>.</p>

								<p align="justify">Outside of research, I'm very devoted to my main hobby - photography. Before starting my scientific career, I had a little detour and studied filmmaking in London for a while. The artistic career didn't last, but my love for the arts did. I'm an amateur urban/street photographer. My works have been used in different places (album covers, articles, promo materials, etc.) and highlighted, e.g., by Samsung on their Instagram. Most of my current works can be found on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ishootambience/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ishootambience">Unsplash</a>. Besides, I love reading, watching TV shows, curating playlists for different occasions (and, as such, listening to music extensively), and cooking. I'm also very dedicated to mindfulness practices and advocate for mental health wherever (and whenever) I can.</p>

								<h3>Water Emission Database</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://katarzynadutkowska.github.io/WED/Images/WED_logo.jpeg" alt="" width="300" /></span>
								<p align="justify">Over the past years, there have been many projects observing water emission towards Galactic and extragalactic regions. With the Water Emission Database I brought all of this data into one place creating a broad-view framework for astrochemical studies. For more information about this project, please visit the following <a href="https://katarzynadutkowska.github.io/WED/">website</a>. </p>
								<h3>The galaxy-in-a-box model</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://katarzynadutkowska.github.io/WED/Images/gal-in-a-box-shadow.jpeg" alt="" width="300" /></span>
								<p align="justify">From observations of the local Universe, we know that most stars form in clusters, and with ALMA, we can now routinely trace molecular emission associated with active star formation at high redshift. The same emission is observed towards nearby well-resolved low-mass star- forming clusters. Thus, by utilizing and extrapolating our knowledge of these clusters, we open a way to understand how most stars form throughout the Universe and constrain global star formation parameters (e.g., star formation rate, star formation efficiency, or initial mass function). However, it requires a tool, working as a proxy, and because of that, I developed a galactic model of emission from massive young clusters, the so-called galaxy-in-a-box model. This model is the first of its kind, as it is a top-level observation-based astrophysical tool simulating molecular emission from the most active stages of star formation in galaxies. The model is available to the public, and in case you are interested in it or would like to collaborate, please contact me directly. </p>
